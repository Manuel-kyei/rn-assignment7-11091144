This repository contains my implementation of a mobile application using React Native for an assignment involving product listing, detail view, and cart management.






Features Implemented:



HomeScreen:

Displays a list of available products fetched from an external API using axios.
Each product has an "Add to Cart" button.
Navigation drawer accessible via swipe or button for navigation.





ProductDetailScreen:

Shows detailed information about a selected product.
Includes a button to add the product to the cart.





CartScreen:

Lists selected items.
Allows users to remove items from the cart.




Data Management:

Asynchronous operations managed using async/await for API calls and local storage operations.




Local Storage:

Utilizes AsyncStorage to persist selected items locally on the device.
